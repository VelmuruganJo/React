        I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in programming and software development.
        I have completed a comprehensive Java Full Stack Development course, where I built web applications using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks.

        As a fresher, I bring eagerness to learn, a problem-solving mindset, and a passion for writing clean, efficient code. I'm especially interested in backend development and enjoy understanding systems under the hood.
